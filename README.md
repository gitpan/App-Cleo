# App-Cleo: Play back shell commands for live demonstrations

"cleo" is a utility for playing back pre-recorded shell commands for a live
demonstration.  "cleo" displays the commands as if you had actually typed them
and then executes them interactively.

There is probably an easy way to do this with "expect" or a similar
tool.  But I couldn't figure it out, so I built this.  Your mileage may
vary.
